Create an API in .NET Core that allows you to manage customers, their contact info, and their orders for Acme Corp.
- Authentication/Authorization - API Key - see valid value in appsettings.json
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Demonstrates use of SOLID and DDD principles
- ‘docker-compose up’ should start the API, perform any DB migrations (if needed), spawn dependent resources etc.
- Check in code to personal GH repo and reply with the link
- IaC to deploy to AWS is a bonus
- Publish the results to a github link and send a link to me, I will share with the team to evaluate.
